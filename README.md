# Geo-weather API

This API combines the Mapquest directions API and the Dark Sky weather API to provide weather over time along a route. You supply the start point and end point, and optionally the mode of transportation, start time, and forecast increment. The API will return a forecast with location and time data for the duration of your trip.
